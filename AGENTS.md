## Project Overview

name: **hams** (hamster) — declarative IaC environment management for macOS/Linux workstations.
Wraps existing package managers (Homebrew, pnpm, npm, apt, etc.) to auto-record installations
into YAML config files ("Hamsfiles"), enabling one-command environment restoration on new machines.

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| Go module | `github.com/zthxxx/hams` |
| Go version | 1.26 |
| DI framework | [Uber Fx](https://github.com/uber-go/fx) |
| Entry point | `cmd/hams/main.go` |
| i18n framework | [go-i18n](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n) |
| JS runtime | Bun (not Node.js) |
| JS package manager | pnpm (`saveExact: true`) |
| npm package name | `harms` |

## First Principle: Isolated Verification

hams is a real-world package management tool that modifies the host system. **You cannot trust any change to the host machine before development is complete and verification has passed.** Isolated verification is paramount.

You MUST simulate real scenarios (install, download, update, config read/write, etc.) to prove the entire flow works end-to-end — in these two isolated environments ONLY:

1. **DI-isolated unit tests** — inject mock boundaries for filesystem, exec, network. Zero side effects on the host.
2. **Docker-containerized E2E tests** — run via `act` against `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Real package managers, real filesystems, real commands — but inside throwaway containers.

**Never run hams operations that mutate the host** (install packages, write config outside `t.TempDir()`, execute provider commands) during development or testing. If it touches the real machine, it belongs inside a container.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Declarative serialization of host state** — record what's installed into YAML, replay on new machines.
2. **Real-world pragmatism** — not NixOS-level strict; calls existing package managers; allows latest-version installs.
3. **CLI-first, auto-record** — `hams brew install git` installs AND records. No hand-editing config first.
4. **One-command restore** — `hams apply --from-repo=zthxxx/hams-store` on a fresh machine.
5. **Diff-based updates** — hand-edit YAML, `hams apply` diffs against state and reconciles.

## Dev Commands

All tasks via [go-task](https://taskfile.dev/) — run `task --list` for full list.

```bash
task setup    # Install dev tools
task build   # Build to bin/hams
task check   # fmt → lint → test
```

Single test: `go test -race -run TestFuncName ./path/to/package/...`

## Tooling

| Tool | Purpose | Config |
|------|---------|--------|
| golangci-lint v2 | Go linting (30+ linters, strict) | `.golangci.yml` |
| ESLint 9 | JS/TS linting (flat config) | `eslint.config.ts` |
| markdownlint-cli2 | Markdown linting | `.markdownlint.yaml` |
| cspell | Spell checking | `cspell.yaml` |
| lefthook | Git hooks (pre-commit: fmt+lint, pre-push: test) | `lefthook.yml` |
| GitHub Actions | CI pipeline | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |

## Architecture at a Glance

- **Provider plugin system**: builtins compiled in Go, externals via `hashicorp/go-plugin` (local gRPC).
- **Terraform-style state**: `.state/<machine-id>/<Provider>.state.yaml`, single-writer lock, refresh-then-diff.
- **TUI**: BubbleTea models scaffolded at `internal/tui/` (alternate screen, collapsible logs, popup) but **unwired in v1**; CLI uses plain `slog` log lines. v1.1 will plug `tui.RunApplyTUI` into `runApply`. See `openspec/changes/2026-04-16-defer-tui-and-notify/`.
- **OTel**: trace + metrics, local file exporter at `${HAMS_DATA_HOME}/otel/`.
- **Docs**: Nextra on GitHub Pages at `hams.zthxxx.me`.

15 builtin providers: Bash, Homebrew, apt, pnpm, npm, uv, goinstall, cargo, VS Code Extensions (`code-ext`), git (config/clone), defaults, duti, mas, Ansible.

## Directory Conventions

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `HAMS_CONFIG_HOME` | `~/.config/hams/` | Global config (`hams.config.yaml`) |
| `HAMS_DATA_HOME` | `~/.local/share/hams/` | Logs, OTel, cloned repos |

Store repo layout (profile-as-directory):

```text
<store>/
  hams.config.yaml              # Project config (git-tracked)
  hams.config.local.yaml        # Local overrides (not tracked)
  .state/<machine-id>/          # State files (.gitignore'd)
  <profile-tag>/                # e.g. "macOS", "openwrt"
    <Provider>.hams.yaml        # Shared config
    <Provider>.hams.local.yaml  # Machine-specific
```

## Build & Distribution

This project is designed exclusively for *nix environments, such as Linux(Debian/Alpine) and macOS.
It does not support, nor are there plans to support, Windows environments.

Static binary (`CGO_ENABLED=0`), targets: darwin/arm64, linux/amd64, linux/arm64.
Bundles go-git for fresh machines without git. Install: `curl | bash`, `brew install`, or GitHub Releases.

## Where to Find Details

- For developer, Function, Design in OpenSpec: `openspec/`
- For Agent: `.claude/`
- For user, how to use: `docs/`

## OpenSpec

This project uses [OpenSpec](https://openspec.dev) for spec-driven development.

### Directory Structure

- `openspec/specs/` — Current capabilities that ARE built and deployed; the authoritative "as-is" state.
  - `{capability}/spec.md` — Requirements for one capability, written as `SHALL`/`MUST` statements with `#### Scenario:` blocks.
  - Never edit specs directly — specs are updated only by archiving a deployed change.
  - One capability per folder; keep names noun-based and stable (e.g., `auth`, `billing`, not `add-auth`).

- `openspec/changes/` — In-flight proposals: features being designed, built, or reviewed but NOT yet deployed.
  - `{change-id}/proposal.md` — Why the change exists, what it affects, user impact.
  - `{change-id}/tasks.md` — Checklist of implementation steps; check off `- [ ]` as work progresses.
  - `{change-id}/tasks/{capability}.task.md` — Complex tasks broken down into an independent file, linked from the main `tasks.md`.
  - `{change-id}/design.md` — Optional; only for non-trivial technical decisions, tradeoffs, alternatives.
  - `{change-id}/specs/{capability}/spec.md` — Spec deltas using `## ADDED`/`## MODIFIED`/`## REMOVED` headers, NOT full rewrites.
  - Change IDs are kebab-case verbs (`add-oauth-login`, `refactor-payment-flow`); never reuse an ID.
  - One change = one coherent shippable unit; split if it spans unrelated capabilities.

- `openspec/archive/` — Completed changes moved here after deployment; their deltas have been merged into `specs/`. Agents do not need to read this.

### Core Principles

- **Specs lag reality intentionally** — they reflect shipped behavior, not aspirations; aspirations live in `changes/`.
- **Propose before coding** — create the change folder first so humans/AI align on intent before implementation drift.
- **Deltas, not rewrites** — change specs describe diffs against current specs, making review and merging tractable.
- **Scenarios are mandatory** — every requirement needs at least one `#### Scenario:` block, otherwise validation fails.

## Current Tasks


Outstanding tasks not yet completed:

- [ ] Archive all implemented OpenSpec changes — move them into the archive for completed history.

Everything aims at keeping onboarding simple and easy for new users, so the following are also required:

- [ ] `hams apply` MUST directly accept a `--tag` argument, with precedence: `--tag` > profile tag in config > default `tag: default`. This enables single-command restoration from a repo. If no hams config file exists when `hams apply` runs, auto-create one at the default location.
- [ ] When running `hams <provider> ...`, if no hams config file repo exists yet, auto-create one at the default location, pre-initialized with `git init` (via command invocation) and a `.gitignore` (from a template file, e.g., containing `.state`), then write the hams config file (create if missing).
  - Technically, pick a directory to serve as the template and bundle its structure + file contents into the binary for ease of development and maintenance.
- [ ] Provider wrapped commands MUST behave exactly like the original command, at least at the first-level command entry point. Therefore:
  - [ ] The `git-clone` and `git-config` providers should be merged into a unified `git` provider, exposing only the `hams git` entry point.
  - [ ] The `code-ext` provider likewise should expose only the `hams code` entry point.
    - [ ] `code` refers specifically to VSCode. If Cursor support is needed, implement a separate `cursor` provider rather than configuring `cli_command: cursor`.
  - [ ] All providers follow the same pattern: parse the original command structure, extract what needs to be recorded, then pass the remainder through to the underlying command for execution. Since providers are structurally similar at the code level, design shared abstractions — either a single generic base or a few categorical base types — so that extending with a new provider is a matter of filling in a well-defined template, not reimplementing the pattern from scratch.

- [ ] Whether logging is emitted — for each provider as well as for hams itself — must be verified in integration tests.
- [ ] CLI user-facing messages and error messages do not yet implement i18n (internationalization), but our standards mandate i18n support. All missing pieces must be implemented. Log records do not require i18n.
- [ ] If all other tasks have been completed, then re-run the overall verification to pass.


All of these tasks are driven and completed using the OpenSpec workflow, when you archive you work completed, you mark the checklist done.
