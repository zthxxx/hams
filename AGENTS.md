Guidance for Claude Code agents working in this repository.

## Project Overview

name: **hams** (hamster) — declarative IaC environment management for macOS/Linux workstations.
Wraps existing package managers (Homebrew, pnpm, npm, apt, etc.) to auto-record installations
into YAML config files ("Hamsfiles"), enabling one-command environment restoration on new machines.

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| Go module | `github.com/zthxxx/hams` |
| Go version | 1.24 |
| DI framework | [Uber Fx](https://github.com/uber-go/fx) |
| Entry point | `cmd/hams/main.go` |
| JS runtime | Bun (not Node.js) |
| JS package manager | pnpm (`saveExact: true`) |
| npm package name | `harms` |

## Core Philosophy

1. **Declarative serialization of host state** — record what's installed into YAML, replay on new machines.
2. **Real-world pragmatism** — not NixOS-level strict; calls existing package managers; allows latest-version installs.
3. **CLI-first, auto-record** — `hams brew install git` installs AND records. No hand-editing config first.
4. **One-command restore** — `hams apply --from-repo=zthxxx/hams-store` on a fresh machine.
5. **Diff-based updates** — hand-edit YAML, `hams apply` diffs against state and reconciles.

## Dev Commands

All tasks via [go-task](https://taskfile.dev/) — run `task --list` for full list.

```bash
task setup    # Install dev tools       task build   # Build to bin/hams
task test     # Tests with -race        task lint    # All linters
task fmt      # gofmt + goimports       task check   # fmt → lint → test
```

Single test: `go test -race -run TestFuncName ./path/to/package/...`

## Tooling

| Tool | Purpose | Config |
|------|---------|--------|
| golangci-lint v2 | Go linting (30+ linters, strict) | `.golangci.yml` |
| ESLint 9 | JS/TS linting (flat config) | `eslint.config.js` |
| markdownlint-cli2 | Markdown linting | `.markdownlint.yaml` |
| cspell | Spell checking | `cspell.yaml` |
| lefthook | Git hooks (pre-commit: fmt+lint, pre-push: test) | `lefthook.yml` |
| GitHub Actions | CI pipeline | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |

## Architecture at a Glance

- **Provider plugin system**: builtins compiled in Go, externals via `hashicorp/go-plugin` (local gRPC).
- **Terraform-style state**: `.state/<machine-id>/<Provider>.state.yaml`, single-writer lock, refresh-then-diff.
- **TUI**: BubbleTea alternate screen, collapsible logs, interactive popup for stdin.
- **OTel**: trace + metrics, local file exporter at `${HAMS_DATA_HOME}/otel/`.
- **Docs**: Nextra on GitHub Pages at `hams.zthxxx.me`.

15 builtin providers: Bash, Homebrew, apt, pnpm, npm, uv, go, cargo, VSCode Extension, git (config/clone), defaults, duti, mas, Ansible.

## Directory Conventions

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `HAMS_CONFIG_HOME` | `~/.config/hams/` | Global config (`hams.config.yaml`) |
| `HAMS_DATA_HOME` | `~/.local/share/hams/` | Logs, OTel, cloned repos |

Store repo layout (profile-as-directory):

```text
<store>/
  hams.config.yaml              # Project config (git-tracked)
  hams.config.local.yaml        # Local overrides (not tracked)
  .state/<machine-id>/          # State files (.gitignore'd)
  <profile-tag>/                # e.g. "macOS", "openwrt"
    <Provider>.hams.yaml        # Shared config
    <Provider>.hams.local.yaml  # Machine-specific
```

## Build & Distribution

This project is designed exclusively for *nix environments, such as Linux(Debian/Alpline) and macOS.
It does not support, nor are there plans to support, Windows environments.

Static binary (`CGO_ENABLED=0`), targets: darwin/arm64, linux/amd64, linux/arm64.
Bundles go-git for fresh machines without git. Install: `curl | bash`, `brew install`, or GitHub Releases.

## Where to Find Details

- For developer, Function, Design in OpenSpec: `openspec/`
- For Agent: `.claude/`
- For user, how to use: `docs/`

## OpenSpec

This project uses [OpenSpec](https://openspec.dev) for spec-driven development.

### Directory Structure

- `openspec/specs/` — Current capabilities that ARE built and deployed; the authoritative "as-is" state.
  - `{capability}/spec.md` — Requirements for one capability, written as `SHALL`/`MUST` statements with `#### Scenario:` blocks.
  - Never edit specs directly — specs are updated only by archiving a deployed change.
  - One capability per folder; keep names noun-based and stable (e.g., `auth`, `billing`, not `add-auth`).

- `openspec/changes/` — In-flight proposals: features being designed, built, or reviewed but NOT yet deployed.
  - `{change-id}/proposal.md` — Why the change exists, what it affects, user impact.
  - `{change-id}/tasks.md` — Checklist of implementation steps; check off `- [x]` as work progresses.
  - `{change-id}/tasks/{capability}.task.md` — Complex tasks broken down into an independent file, linked from the main `tasks.md`.
  - `{change-id}/design.md` — Optional; only for non-trivial technical decisions, tradeoffs, alternatives.
  - `{change-id}/specs/{capability}/spec.md` — Spec deltas using `## ADDED`/`## MODIFIED`/`## REMOVED` headers, NOT full rewrites.
  - Change IDs are kebab-case verbs (`add-oauth-login`, `refactor-payment-flow`); never reuse an ID.
  - One change = one coherent shippable unit; split if it spans unrelated capabilities.

- `openspec/archive/` — Completed changes moved here after deployment; their deltas have been merged into `specs/`. Agents do not need to read this.

### Core Principles

- **Specs lag reality intentionally** — they reflect shipped behavior, not aspirations; aspirations live in `changes/`.
- **Propose before coding** — create the change folder first so humans/AI align on intent before implementation drift.
- **Deltas, not rewrites** — change specs describe diffs against current specs, making review and merging tractable.
- **Scenarios are mandatory** — every requirement needs at least one `#### Scenario:` block, otherwise validation fails.
